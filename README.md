# Drone Wars

I want you to help with my game creation by asking me questions about what I want as a long list of MCQs.


Game setting:


The game is set on the Titanic . A team who have drones and satellites  are sent back with the objective of saving a number of famous wealthy people that died . 


The team travel back with 10s of radar and some boats that can be deployed from space that land near the titanic and some drones that can be flown with fibre optic cables. The drones can be used to spot icebergs within 20 km . 


Gameplay:


The screen is divided in 4 at all times . 
The top left is used for voice control and has the whisper input and output and if the command was successful it looks like a command line  . 


The top right is a radar  image sky but in this place icebergs are marked automatically when they are spotted by the drones and identified as risks. Some icebergs are not risks.  We need to use some db of icebergs that is realistic for the north sea.  This also shows the boat. 


The bottom left is a lidar image from the drone flying into the space it was instructed .


The bottom right is the ship movement and max potential  movement left and right . 


Game control : Only operated by voice and the comment is interpreted by whisper or a free voice to text and converted into a command. Identifying areas for the drone to explore using grid names in a 32 x 32 grid on the top right . 




It should be similar to a sort of flight sim only for boats and drones.
